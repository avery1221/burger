I added the basic description for how i made this application in the commits but, basically i started by doing all of my npm installs and then making my server.js and sql files so this application could be seen in my localhost so that i know i have established a proper connection then i went on to make the routes and orm pages that go along with connection and server pages that allow to to view this online. after that i tested all of my functions and made sure they worked and then went on to make my handlebards pages and then format the application to a design that i liked.
